# Automated Home Lab Orchestration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for creating an automated home lab environment that facilitates parallel evaluation of different technologies and approaches.

## Key Objectives
1. Enable simultaneous testing of multiple solution approaches
2. Provide consistent evaluation environments
3. Automate deployment and teardown of test scenarios
4. Support parallel validation of architectural decisions

## Components

### Infrastructure Layer
- Virtualization platform for isolated environments
- Network segmentation for parallel testing
- Resource management and allocation
- Automated provisioning and teardown

### Evaluation Framework
- Standardized testing methodologies
- Performance metrics collection
- Comparison tools and dashboards
- Documentation templates
  - Solution briefs
  - Scorecards
  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Automation Tools
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
- CI/CD pipelines for test execution
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Results aggregation and reporting

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Basic virtualization infrastructure
2. Network configuration
3. Storage allocation
4. Initial automation scripts

### Phase 2: Framework Development
1. Test environment templates
2. Evaluation criteria definition
3. Metrics collection setup
4. Basic reporting tools

### Phase 3: Automation Enhancement
1. Full CI/CD integration
2. Automated resource management
3. Advanced monitoring
4. Comprehensive reporting

## Evaluation Process
1. Solution proposal documentation
2. Environment provisioning
3. Parallel testing execution
4. Metrics collection
5. Results comparison
6. Decision documentation

## Repository Integration
This plan aligns with the repository structure:
- `/docs/decisions/` - For recording final architecture decisions
- `/docs/templates/` - For standardized documentation
- `/solutions/` - For implementing and testing different approaches

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. Set up initial test environments
3. Create first comparison templates
4. Document baseline metrics

## Success Criteria
- Multiple solutions can be evaluated simultaneously
- Consistent testing environments are maintained
- Results are comparable and well-documented
- Quick iteration on different approaches is possible
- Clear decision-making process is established
